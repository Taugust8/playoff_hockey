Welcome O2, on the playoff hockey game ! 🏒🎮

To run the game, type 'php script.php' in the command line. ⌨️

If you want to modify the game, you just have to modify the class constants. 😌

When the constant for the number of teams in the game is modified, it is also necessary to modify the constant for the letters for the teams so as to have as many different letters as there are teams. ⚠️

If you want to add divisions, this is possible via the constant provided for this purpose, however the final will still remain with the first 2 divisions. 😢
